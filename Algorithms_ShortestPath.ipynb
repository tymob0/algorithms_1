    "Dijkstra is a greedy algorithm because it makes a *locally** optimal decision *(see step 4)* with the hope it will reach globally optimal solution at some point. However, as you might observe it doesn't use backtracking simply because there is no need in it. Import aspect is so called \"relaxation\". This is in essence the foundation and main operation in the algorithm. Relaxation is the process of a method that repeatedly decreases an upper bound on the actual shortest path weight of each vertex until the upper bound equivalent the shortest - path weigh *[1]*. It is important to remember that Dijkstra algorithm works only on non-negative weighted graphs."
